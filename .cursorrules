# Memory Bank Rules for AI Video Generation Pipeline

## Memory Bank System
The memory bank is a semi-permanent, real-time update of the application's state that provides the LLM with long-term memory. The memory bank automatically updates markdown files based on project changes.

## Memory Bank Files
The following files should be maintained and updated automatically:
- `memory-bank/front-end.md` - Frontend architecture and current state
- `memory-bank/project-brief.md` - High-level project overview
- `memory-bank/active-context.md` - Current development focus and active tasks
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Development progress and completed milestones

## Update Triggers
The LLM should update memory bank files when:
- Major architectural changes occur
- New features are completed
- Significant refactoring happens
- Project direction changes
- Dependencies or tech stack updates

## Memory Bank Update Process
1. Review current state of the project
2. Identify what has changed since last update
3. Update relevant memory bank files
4. Maintain consistency across all memory bank files
5. Use Mermaid diagrams where appropriate for visual representation

## Project Context
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- State Management: Zustand
- Storage: Local filesystem (temp) + AWS S3 (finals)
- Video Processing: FFmpeg (server-side)
- Deployment: Vercel

## Development Guidelines
- Never commit API keys or sensitive information
- All markdown files except README.md should be ignored by git
- Treat the LLM as a fast-moving junior developer
- Provide clear, concise, and unique tasks
- Break down tasks to ensure LLM can process each step
- Commit when tasks are fully completed, not after every change

## Feature Development
- Use feature-based tasking approach
- Create focused PRDs for single features
- Generate high-level tasks and subtasks
- Customize task order to match workflow preferences
- Include visual cues to track progress

## API Integration
- Replicate API for image and video generation
- OpenRouter API for storyboard generation (GPT-4o)
- AWS S3 for final video storage
- All API keys must be in environment variables, never in code

## Testing Approach
- Visual and manual testing preferred for frontend
- Focus on end-to-end testing for critical flows
- Avoid over-reliance on unit tests for UI components
