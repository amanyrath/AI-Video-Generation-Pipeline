## Current Focus
Setting up project infrastructure and memory bank system for AI Video Generation Pipeline.

## Active Tasks

  - `progress.md`

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up project structure (app router)
3. Configure environment variables template
4. Install dependencies (Zustand, Replicate SDK, etc.)
5. Create shared types file (`/lib/types.ts`)

## Development Environment
- Node.js version: TBD
- Package manager: npm
